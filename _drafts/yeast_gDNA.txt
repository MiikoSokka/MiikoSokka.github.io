Theoretical and observed gDNA yields
S. cerevisiae haploid genome is 12 156 302 bp. Using Dolezel conversion, which says: 1pg = 978Mb, we get  12 156 302 bp/978 000 000bp = 0.01242975664621677 pg genomic DNA per cell, or 12 429.76 pg/106 cells =12.4 ng/106 cells or 12.4  g/109 cells.
For example, an article from 1986 describing GuHCl method gave 6 g/0.5x109 cells, which they claimed to be 75% of theoretical yield. With todays knowledge, 0.5x109 cells contains 0.5x109 cells x 12.4ng / 106 cells = 6200000 ng = 6.2  g, which is nearly 100% yield.
In my hands the yield has been 50-60% of the theoretical total DNA. The volume of DNAzol relative to cell number does not impact to the yield (2017-06-16, yDNA49)
About molarities
Based on #29 yeast gDNA AGE gel migration, the genomic DNA is on average ~17kb (the approximation is not very precise though). Thus, 10ug of yeast gDNA is 0.89 pmol. Reciprocally, RNA-DNA oligo is 40bp and 10ug equals to 378.78 pmol. Calculations were done using Promega.
Using Cadoret's formula, it is estimated that 117ug of yeast gDNA contains theoretically 20ng of nascent strands. This is equivalent to 10.43 pmol of gDNA and 0.02 pmol of nascent strands (given their average size of 1500bp).
	There is ~522-fold molar excess of parental gDNA vs. nascent strands.
	To emulate this, I would need ~22mg (=1978pmol) of gDNA per 100ng (=3.79pmol) of oligo.
	If gDNA would be cut to average size of 1000bp, I would still need 1.3mg of gDNA.
The above thinking applies if I use non-enriched gDNA in Lexo digestion to enrich nascent strands.
If using pre-enrichment step by BND-cellulose, which is estimated to enrich roughly 10-fold, I would still need 130 ug of 1000bp gDNA.
It might be reasonable to use pu27-oligo or to order a control oligo without G4 structure to set the time-course for Lexo.
Another option would be just use qPCR to determine enrichment of known origins.
DNA needed for NS-seq
Cadoret et al. used a formula to estimate theoretical amount of SNS from a cell sample:
Y=2 × (Tns/Tcc)× N*Nori × L × ∈
"where Y is the quantity in grams of estimated SNS. Tns is the lifespan of 1.5-2 kb nascent strands (2 minutes) calculated from the replication fork speed. Tcc is the length of the cell cycle in minutes (for HeLa, 24 h or 1440 min). N is the number of cells used for SNS extraction (1E8). Nori is the estimated number of replication origins needed to replicate the whole human genome during S phase (30,000). L is the average length of isolated SNS (1750 nucleotides). ∈ is the weight of 1 nucleotide (54.81E-23g). With this formula, we estimated that around 10 ng of SNS can be isolated from 1E8 cells (excerpt from Cadoret et al, modified)."
The starting material in Gerbi's Genome Research paper was 150 g of DNA from MCF-7 cells. Modal chromosome number in this cell line is 82. This gives the starting cell count 12.7E6 cells (11.8pg gDNA/cell). With Cadoret's formula, theoretical SNS yield is 19ng (replication fork velocity is estimated to be 1.5kb/min). The observed yield was 21-96ng.
Yeast cell cycle is 90min, number of ORIs is 400 and the replication fork velocity is 2.3kb/min. Aiming for the 20ng yield with yeast, there should be 9.4E9 cells to start with (size-selected for 0.5-1.5kb). Since the yield is around 50%, there should be double the amount of cells, i.e. 19E9. This means 581ml culture with an OD600 of 1.4.

Zymolyase for spheroplasting
Zymolyase is a combination of mainly two enzymes, ß-1,3-glucan laminaripentaohydrolase and alkaline protease (see Kitamura, Agric Biol Chem (1982), 46:963-969). It is purified from Arthrobacter luteus. It is unknown if they work in complex, but both are required for efficient spheroplasting. Reducing agent (DTT or 2-Mercaptoethanol) greatly enhances their activity, but it is unknown if it enhances enzyme activity or affects on cell wall by 'softening' it. Zymolyase comes in two preps, 20T and 100T (20 kU/g and 100 kU/g), where the latter is a form that is purified further. Sodium citrate buffers the solution at slightly acidic, where Zymolyase works better (also other more neutral buffers such as Tris and HEPES has been used). Sorbitol preserves forming spheroplasts so that they don't burst. The amount of SCE relative to cell count used by Holm et al, 1986 Gene 42:169-173, which was 300 l per 109 cells seems to be inadequate and probably twice that amount should be used instead (actually, I mistakenly have used 84ul per 10E9 cells with no problems).

An attempt to reduce RNA in gDNA preps
The high amount of RNA in genomic DNA preps can potentially be a problem when comparing the RNase>PNK vs. PNK>RNase samples. In one experiment(yDNA #37) I compared a) normal method to b) extracting yeast nuclei before DNAzol lysis and c) performing DNAzol for two rounds. Neither of the tweaks reduced the amount of RNA in samples; which were identical in DNA and RNA content as inspected by AGE. Performing literature search I found only vague recent descriptions of extracting nuclei from yeast. A particularly thorough work from 1974 by Doi and Doi (J. Biochem 75: 1017-1026) compared two nuclear isolation methods; detergent-based and an osmotic pressure based lysis. They concluded that isolation of nuclei from yeast had low yield (20-30%), with losing a potentially relevant subpopulation of nuclei. They measured the DNA-RNA ratio, which was similar with both methods (1:~2.8 for DNA:RNA). This ratio was roughly 10-fold less than the one measured from spheroplasts. The authors conclude that the yeast nuclei contain higher RNA:DNA ratio compared to mammalian cells.
It is apparent that extraction of nuclei from yeast is not as simple and straigthforward as from human cells. The yeast nuclei are much smaller and thus more difficult to differentiate from cellular debris; many nuclei are probably lost because of that. In addition, the reduction of RNA may not be significant (only 10-fold) to warrant potentially losing a significant population of cells.
Using tweaks (like reducing ethanol in precipitating DNA) in an attempt to favor DNA precipitation over RNA, may not be a good strategy either. If the nascent strands are easily displaced from pairing in the parental strands, it may be that we end up losing these single-stranded nascent strands along with RNA.
DNAzol Extraction
After obtaining spheroplasts, there are few critical steps in using DNAzol. Proteinase K is essential (according to Mechali group, who uses 200 g/ml in DNAzol for two hours at 37°C, on rotation). After two hours proteinase K, the solution becomes uniform. Centrifugation after this is essential to get rid of most of the RNA, insoluble cell wall material and non-lysed cells. Solubilization of the precipitated DNA was surprisingly easy, when I used TEN20 buffer (includes SDS and NaCl) and heating at 70°C. The pellet was completely dissolved in couple of minutes. The eluate should be centrifuged at this point 10'/12000g to get rid of the polysaccharides.
For the purification of ZYM#29 yDNA I used 1ml of DNAzol per 50x107 cells, while the recommendation is 1ml per 1-3x107. Too little DNAzol leads to co-purification of RNA, which can be avoided by using greater volume-to-cells ratio. Another workaround can be two rounds of DNAzol purification.
DNAzol contains chaotropic agent guanidium thiocyanate, which exists as a guanidium cation (Gdm+) and thiocyanate anion (SCN-). These ions are among the strongest known protein denaturants (Mason et al, 2003 PNAS 100:4557-4561). The detailed mechanism of action is unknown, but Gdm binds to proteins contributing significantly to denaturation. SCN in turn promotes salting out of proteins, by neutralizing the positive charge.
The volume of DNAzol relative to protein and nucleic acid content of the sample is likely critical for efficient recovery of DNA. The official protocol of DNAzol suggests using 1-3E7 cells per 1ml of DNAzol. However, the protein and DNA content of different species and cell lines differ drastically. For example, if using 1E7 HeLa cells and 1ml of DNAzol, the DNAzol volume relative to DNA and protein content is 1ml/0.3 g DNA and 1ml/0.67mg protein. In contrast, for 1E7 budding yeast cells this would be 1ml/81 g DNA and 1ml/20mg protein. Clearly, smaller volumes can be used for the yeast. The protein content of HeLa cell is 30x that of budding yeast. Using that as a guideline, 1ml DNAzol for 1E9 yeast cells should be fine.
I tested (2017-06-16, yDNA49) 2ml, 3ml and 9ml DNAzol volumes for 9E9 yeast cells and came to conclusion that the yield was similar with 2ml and 9ml (50-60%). In fact, lower can be better since more RNA was recovered with 9ml.
Removal of polysaccharides
DNAzol-prepared genomic DNA form yeast contains lot of polysaccharides, which can be seen as a viscous, glue-like appearance of the DNA solution (which should be clear). Neither centrifugation step, nor purification of the DNA with AMPure or ethanol precipitation is not enough to get rid of the polysaccharides, which coprecipitate with the DNA.
Plant biologists use CTAB that selectively binds to polysaccharides. A protocol for bacterial gDNA preparation has been published in Current Protocols by Kate Wilson. In this protocol, polysaccharides are bound to CTAB by heating 10'/65°C in the precence of over 700mM NaCl and then using chloroform and phenol to separate CTAB/polysaccharides in an interface between organic and aqueous phases. I tested heating at 50°C for 10' and it seems to work as well. Strangely, the original protocol uses first chloroform and after that phenol/chloroform, while more commonly this is done the other way round. Residual phenol can inhibit with subsequent enzymatic reactions and this is prevented by washing samples with chloroform after phenol. In my case, I don't necessarily need phenol because DNAzol strips the samples off of proteins. I tested that only one chloroform wash is enough to get rid of polysaccharides. It is likely that SDS in the TEN20S buffer used for DNA solubilization effectively promotes separation of polysaccharides in the interface. SDS has been used for extracting saccharides. There is a trade-off such that some DNA sample is lost when it is necessary to leave some of the aqueous phase on top of the interface. Using wide-bore pipette tip helps to prevent sucking in the interface.
