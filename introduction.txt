#Introduction for the technical blog, describing small projects

Research in molecular biology can be frustrating. Working on a project for months, even years, and finally producing a single published paper does not really contribute to the feeling of productivity.

There is a lot of work behind a single paper and not everything that you have done in the wet lab or in silico can be included in the manuscript.

I have collected here the data for small projects that I have done and discuss about the observations and notions along the journey that I have made.

This I do in hope that someone will benefit of the research I've done.

These writings do not even try to be a comprehensive guide to show how to do things. Instead, they are meant to share my approach of doing things and show what day-to-day life is at the lab.

I have decided to publish the data that I have collected over the course of wet lab research.
